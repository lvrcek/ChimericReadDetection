# Ram

[![Latest GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/lbcb-sci/ram.svg)](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/ram/releases/latest)
[![Build status for c++/clang++](https://travis-ci.org/lbcb-sci/ram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lbcb-sci/ram)

Ram is a c++ implementation of [minimap](https://github.com/lh3/minimap) with few modifications.

# Usage

To build ram run the following commands:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lbcb-sci/ram.git ram
cd ram && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -Dram_build_executable=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
./bin/ram
```
which will display the following usage:
```bash
usage: ram [options ...] <target> [<sequences>]

  # default output is stdout
  <target>/<sequences>
    input file in FASTA/FASTQ format (can be compressed with gzip)

  options:
    -k, --kmer-length <int>
      default: 15
      length of minimizers
    -w, --window-length <int>
      default: 5
      length of sliding window from which minimizers are found
    -f, --frequency-threshold <float>
      default: 0.001
      threshold for ignoring most frequent minimizers
    -m, --micromize
      use only a portion of all minimizers
    -t, --threads <int>
      default: 1
      number of threads
    --version
      prints the version number
    -h, --help
      prints the usage
```

If you would like to add ram as a library to your project via CMake, add the following:
```cmake
if (NOT TARGET ram)
  add_subdirectory(<path_to_submodules>/ram EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
endif ()
target_link_libraries(<your_exe> ram)
```

#### Dependencies

- gcc 4.8+ or clang 3.5+
- cmake 3.9+
- zlib (for binary only)

## Unit tests

To build ram unit tests run the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lbcb-sci/ram.git ram
cd ram && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -Dram_build_tests=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
./bin/ram_test
```

#### Dependencies
- gtest
